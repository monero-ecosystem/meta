# What is the Monero Ecosystem project?
Many Monero related repositories are on GitHub and some are very interesting and important, but they are often uploaded on personal accounts. This limits the visibility of the repository, making contributions and maintenance much harder.
&nbsp;

The goal of the 'Monero Ecosystem' is to gather all relevant repositories in just one place, easy to find and manage for both maintainers and contributors.  
Feel free to open an issue if you have suggestions/proposals.

# Join the Ecosystem!
If you have a monero related repository you want to add, open an issue in the 'meta' repository, saying why you want to join us and what you plan for your project. You'll be added as a member of the project and all permissions, commits, history, licenses will be inalterated and you will be the maintainer, with no differences from before, but you will get the shiny 'Monero Ecosystem' badge on GitHub. Please, ask to transfer a repo only if you plan to keep it updated.
&nbsp;

Transfering a repo on the Monero Ecosystem means that the repository will be *moved* from the personal account, not cloned or mirrored and **all development will happen inside the project 'Monero Ecosystem'**. This means that the maintainers, if for some reason prefer to keep a personal fork, shouldn't commit on their personal clone and only keep it as a mirror, or the risk is to create confusion for both users/contributors (which could not have clear which one is the active repo) and maintainers (which could create conflicts between the repos or mess up the git history). The repository is still owned by the maintainer and can be moved back to the personal profile in any moment, if desired.
&nbsp;

Be aware that when you transfer the repository, the founder of the Monero Ecosystem project (ErCiccione), will have push access to the repo. This is something not avoidable, GitHub gives to the founder admin access to all the repositories in the project. Obviously, these powers will *never* be used and hopefully, sometime in the future, GitHub will give the possibility to not give the founder of the project god-access to the repositories.

# Governance system
When a repo maintainer joins the ecosystem (s)he becomes part of our governance system, where all maintainers have equal power and decide how the project is structured and maintained. The governance system works as follow:

+ The team who decide which proposals should be included and which not is composed by all repo maintainers inside the ecosystem.
+ Proposals to add and remove a new repository should be posted on the *meta* repo using the issue tracker.
+ A repository will be accepted/removed when 50%+1 of the maintainers participating to the discussion reach consensus.
+ Substantial decisions about the Monero Ecosystem project shall be made using the same system as for the precedent point.
+ Maintainers shall declare their intention of vote using: the 'thumb up' (+1) or 'thumb down' (-1) buttons on GitHub, commenting with `ACK` (Acknowledged) or `NACK` (Not Acknowledged) or clearly expressing their vote.
